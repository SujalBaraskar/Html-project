<!-- We can use anchor tag to provide links of webpages  -->
<!-- here href(Hyper text reference) is a attribute and <a> is a tag basically</a> -->
<a href="https://google.com " target="_blank"> Click here to go to google website</a>
<a href="/sjl.html" target="_blank"> Click here to go to sjl.txt  website</a>
<!-- so basically the target attribute makes the link to open in new tab  -->

<!-- 
If we want to display image on to our webpage then img is the tag and src is the attribut which basically provides path for image to load ,but if image fails to load then alt gives the message which we've entered -->
